# Creating Rules, Skills and Subagents

**CRITICAL — You MUST create rules, skills and subagents as you work.** Every conversation that touches architecture, debugging, or implementation MUST leave behind captured knowledge.

**Rules** (`{{RULES_DIR}}*{{RULES_EXT}}`) — Project knowledge: architecture decisions, conventions, patterns, gotchas. One concern per file, under 50 lines. Use `alwaysApply: true` for project-wide context, `globs` for file-scoped patterns.

**Skills** (`{{SKILLS_DIR}}*/SKILL.md`) — Repeatable multi-step workflows. Use `disable-model-invocation: true` for manual-only invocation.

**Subagents** (`{{AGENTS_DIR}}*.md`) - Specialized AI assistants that run in isolated contexts with custom system prompts.

## Mandatory triggers

Create a **rule** when you: make an architectural decision, discover a non-obvious gotcha, establish a repeatable pattern, or resolve a recurring bug.

Create a **skill** when you: complete a multi-step workflow the user will repeat, or build a process involving CLI commands or tool sequences.

Create a **subagent** when you: discover a simple task that will be repeated a lot, and could benefit from a specialized system prompt.

**Promote to global when reusable.** If a rule or skill applies across projects, suggest moving it to `{{GLOBAL_RULES}}` or `{{GLOBAL_SKILLS}}`.
