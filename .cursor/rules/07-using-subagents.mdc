# Using Subagents and Skills

**Subagents** (`{{AGENTS_DIR}}`) — Specialized agents invoked for specific steps. When a plan or todo names a subagent (e.g. vitest-writer, quartz-docs-author, verifier), invoke that subagent when performing that step. The subagent’s `description` drives when the agent suggests it; use the named subagent rather than doing the step manually when the plan references it.

**Skills** (`{{SKILLS_DIR}}`) — Repeatable workflows. When implementing a plan, use skills referenced in the plan (e.g. optimize-agent-rules for optimizing a prompt, organize-commits for version control with git). Create or update a skill when the work produces a new multi-step workflow worth reusing.

Keep this rule short; see [Rules and Skills](06-rules-and-skills.mdc) for when to create rules vs skills and for global promotion.
