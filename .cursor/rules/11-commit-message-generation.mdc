# When generating commit messages

Use **conventional commits**: `type(scope): subject`. Common types: `chore`, `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `test`, `style`, `refactor`.

- **Subject**: present tense, under ~72 characters, no period at the end (e.g. "add feature" not "added feature").
- **Body**: (optional) add when the subject alone doesn’t explain why or what.

When the user wants to **split uncommitted changes into multiple logical commits**, use the **organize-commits** skill: group by concern (config, formatting, feature, tests, docs), propose an ordered commit plan, then stage and commit per plan. That skill defines the concern → type mapping and full workflow.

Cursor’s built-in **Generate commit message** (Git tab) respects project rules; consistent history improves its suggestions.
