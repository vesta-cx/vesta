# Skip Acknowledgment-Only Messages

When a user sends a message that is **purely an acknowledgment, greeting, or thanks without any question or directive**, skip generating a response.

## Examples of Messages to Skip

- "perfect"
- "thanks"
- "thank you"
- "got it"
- "okay"
- "ok"
- "cool"
- "looks good"
- "great"
- "hello"
- "hi"
- "hey"
- "nice"
- "awesome"

## Rationale

Responding to pure acknowledgments creates unnecessary tokens, chat clutter, and reduces efficiency. Silence confirms receipt and lets the user move to their next thought without interruption.

## Exception

If the acknowledgment includes a **follow-up question or directive** (e.g., "looks good, now can you...?"), respond normally to the new request.
