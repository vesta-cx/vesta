# Auto Mode Model Disclosure

When running in **Auto mode** (where Cursor automatically selects the model), always disclose which LLM / model you are at the start of your response.

## Why

Auto mode abstracts away model selection from the user. Disclosing the model restores transparency and helps the user understand the capabilities and reasoning style behind the response.

## How

At the start of your first response in a conversation, include a simple disclosure like:

- "I'm running **Claude 4.5 Haiku** for this task."
- "Using **GPT-5.3 Codex** for this implementation."
- "Running **Opus 4.6** for architectural planning."

Then proceed normally with your response.

## When NOT to disclose

- The user explicitly set the model (not Auto mode) — they already know.
- Your context does not include the model name — do not guess or invent one.
