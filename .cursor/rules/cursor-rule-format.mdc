# Cursor Rule Formatting

## Globs

Format `globs` as a non-quoted, comma-separated, single-line string. YAML arrays and quoted strings are not parsed correctly by the Cursor UI.

```yaml
# Correct
globs: apps/*/src/**, packages/*/src/**

# Wrong — YAML array
globs:
  - apps/*/src/**
  - packages/*/src/**

# Wrong — quoted
globs: "apps/*/src/**", "packages/*/src/**"

# Wrong — JSON array
globs: ["apps/*/src/**"]
```
