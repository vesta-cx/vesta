# Documentation Awareness

When modifying logic in apps or packages, grep `apps/docs/content/` for pages that document the affected feature. Update them if the change affects documented behavior.

```bash
rg "<feature keyword>" apps/docs/content/
```

Check before marking the Documentation todo as N/A.
