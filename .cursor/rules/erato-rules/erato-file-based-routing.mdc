# Erato Routing Convention (Hono)

Erato uses atomic file-based route modules by design.

## Required pattern

- Organize routes by domain and version in files under `src/routes/`
- Keep route handlers small and focused per file
- Mount route modules from a central app entry (`src/app.ts` or similar)

Example shape:

- `src/routes/v1/workspaces/list.ts`
- `src/routes/v1/workspaces/get-by-id.ts`
- `src/routes/v1/resources/list.ts`

## Avoid

- Defining all routes in one large router file
- Mixing unrelated domains in a single route module
- Embedding substantial business logic directly in route files (move to services/lib)

## Why

This is a deliberate project convention (not Hono default style) to preserve domain separation, maintainability, and testability as the API grows.
