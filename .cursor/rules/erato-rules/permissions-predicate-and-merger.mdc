# Erato Permission Predicate + Merger

When checking row-level permissions in Erato, always match the full tuple:

- `subjectType`
- `subjectId`
- `objectType`
- `objectId`
- `action`
- `value`

Do not rely on partial predicates (for example `subjectId` + `objectType` only), because they can leak access across actions or subject domains.

## Merger ownership

- `packages/utils` owns the stateless permission merger.
- Apps/clients (Erato/web/headless) own database reads and membership expansion.
- Fetch permission rows in bulk, then merge in memory.

## Owner override

Owners always have read/write/delete access to their own objects, regardless of permission rows.
