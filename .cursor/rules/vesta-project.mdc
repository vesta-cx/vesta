# Vesta Project

Vesta is a pnpm + Turborepo monorepo targeting Cloudflare infrastructure.

## Apps

- `apps/sona` — Survey application (quality-survey) to gather data about quality perception
- `apps/euterpe` — Microservice that transcodes audio uploads; called by sona "Upload raw FLAC"
- `apps/erato` — Empty placeholder

## Packages

- `packages/ui` — shadcn-svelte component library (Svelte 5, TailwindCSS v4, Bits-UI, Formsnap, Vaul, Paneforge). Has its own `AGENTS.md` for Svelte MCP server tools.
- `packages/config` — Shared ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, lint-staged configs (built with tsup)
- `packages/utils` — Color utilities, easing functions, number/type helpers (Vitest tested)
- `packages/storage` — `StorageProvider` abstraction; `R2StorageProvider` (Workers), `R2S3StorageProvider` (Node)

## Conventions

- shadcn-svelte component registry: `packages/ui/components.json` (base color: zinc, alias `@` → components)
- All SvelteKit apps use `@sveltejs/adapter-cloudflare`
- Styles in `packages/ui` use SCSS for design tokens; apps consume via Tailwind
